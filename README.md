# NILDB

_The unofficial New Ithkuilic Language Database_

This project aims to maintain a comprehensive database of all lexical, morphological, and phonological information for the New Ithkuilic Language. It may eventually expand to include morpho-phonology. Sources for this information can be found in PDFs posted by /u/zeuhl59 on the [Ithkuil subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Ithkuil).

## Database progress

* [x] Phonology: 100%
* [ ] Roots: ~20% (TODO remove obsolete specifications)
    - [ ] Spatial
    - [x] Motion
    - [ ] Positionally-defined componential parts
    - [x] Personal reference root
    - [x] Copular root
    - [x] General demonstrative root
    - [ ] Colors
    - [ ] Everything else
* [ ] VxCs affixes: 0%
* [ ] Morphology: 0%
    - [ ] Briefs: 67%
    - [ ] Full descriptions: 4%
* [ ] Morpho-phonology: 0%

## Additional TODOs

* [ ] ~~Script to make markdown references~~ _See [TNIL Freedoc](https://github.com/HactarCE/tnil-freedoc/)_
* [ ] Searchable dictionary, like [la sutysisku](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/en/) or [lathiel.fr's](http://www.laethiel.fr/ithkuil/dico.php)

TODO: Explain how `gloss_fmt` and `full_gloss` work.
