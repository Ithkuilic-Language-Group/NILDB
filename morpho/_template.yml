name: category
brief: brief phrase-length description of this category
full: |
  This is a more in-depth description of Category, usually beginning with the
  name of the category. It may be several paragraphs in length, and should be
  wrapped to ~80 characters to keep things consistent.

  Not that the "literal" block scalar style (`|`) is used here rather than
  "folded" (`>`), so newlines are preserved as-is. This is desirable when
  rendering to Markdown or reStructuredText, but in other cases, be aware of
  newlines. YAML terminates the entire with a single newline when parsed.

  Note that `name` and `brief` are lowercased initially, while `abbrev` (later)
  and `full` are capitalized appropraitely. `name` and `brief` should be
  capitalized according to context, whereas `abbrev` and `full` are always
  capitalized.

values:
  - abbr: CV1
    name: value A
    brief: brief phrase-length description of value A
    full: >
      Once again, this is a paragraph or two about Value A. The full description
      should avoid reusing language from the brief description, but should still
      give a solid overview of the category; i.e. it should not assume that the
      reader has seen the brief description, but it should not feel repetitive
      in case they have.

      This full description is optional; you'll note that CV2 has none. Still,
      nearly all category values should have one. (Only numerical categories,
      like stem or VxCs degree, do not need it.) Brief descriptions, on the
      other hand, are always required.
  - abbr: CV2
    name: value B
    brief: a few words
  - abbr: CV3
    name: value C
    brief: “looks like X in a sentence”
    full: >
      Briefs can contain quoted translations as well, using smart double quotes
      `“…”` and a single capital `X` in place of the word carrying the value. A
      non-quoted description is generally better, but sometimes literal words
      are the most efficient way to describe something. Be careful to select a
      translation that disambiguates from other values; e.g. “instead of X”
      could be used as a translation for multiple Cases, but “to avoid X” only
      fits one.
