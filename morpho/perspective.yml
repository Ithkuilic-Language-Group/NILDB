name: perspective
brief: configurative set
full: |
  Perspective quantifies both nominal and verbal stems and can provide
  tense-like information for verbal stems. This category, like that of of
  "Number" in other languages, differentiates between references to one or many
  instances of a root, as well as making possible reference to all instances of
  the root across space and time, or to the underlying concept of the root
  itself. For verbs Perspective works with Aspect and Extension to create
  analogues for many of the "Tenses" found in other languages.
