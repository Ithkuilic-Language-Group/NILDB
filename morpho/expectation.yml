      Once again, this is a paragraph or two about Value A. The full description
      should avoid reusing language from the brief description, but should still
      give a solid overview of the category; i.e. it should not assume that the
      reader has seen the brief description, but it should not feel repetitive
      in case they have.

      This full description is optional; you'll note that CV2 has none. Still,
      nearly all category values should have one. (Only numerical categories,
      like stem or VxCs degree, do not need it.) Brief descriptions, on the
      other hand, are always required.
