name: configuration
brief: physical (dis)similarity and spatiotemporal connectedness
full: |
  CONFIGURATION conveys the quantity, spatiotemporal continuity, and physical
  similarity of the items named by the stem. Unlike [[Affiliation]], this
  category focuses on the physical variation of the items, rather than on
  variations of function or purpose. CONFIGURATION provides mass nouns for stems
  and works together with [[Perspective]] to communicate number. It communicates
  whether the members of a group are separate, touching, or fused together, and
  also provides a way of talking about questionable or borderline applications
  of the stem.
