        The scope of this root's usage is narrow. It is used only in contexts requiring ontological or epistemic equivalence/identity. e.g., “I am your father.” It is not to be used in the following circumstances:

            - when “be” means “be named/called”, e.g., “My dog is [named/called] Toto.” (Use stem meaning “be named; be called; have an appellation”)
            - when “be” initiates an adjectival phrase, e.g., “Rain is beneficial.” (Use adjectival case or a verbal stem, e.g., “to (be of) benefit”)
            - when “be” indicates a spatio-temporal relation, e.g., “The box is on the table” (Use stem signifying the specific relation, e.g., “be on the top surface of”
            - when “be” means “occur / happen / take place”, e.g., “Wednesday is the best day for shopping.” (Use stem meaning “occur, take place, happen”)
            - when “be” means “exist (ontologically)”, e.g., “Such is life”, “I think, therefore I am.” (Use stem meaning “existent entity; to ontologically exist”)
            - when “be” indicates exemplary membership in a set, e.g., “A hammer is a tool.” (Use stem meaning “exemplify; be an example of” or “be a type of”)
            - when “be” indicates composition, e.g., “Rain is water.” (Use stem meaning “to consist of”)
